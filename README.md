# radicle-avatar

A library for generating emoji-color combinations which serve as avatars in
Radicle clients.

Example:
```
assert_eq!(
    Avatar::from("cloudhead", Usage::Identity),
    Avatar {
        emoji: "ðŸŒ»".to_string(),
        background: Color::new(24, 105, 216)
    }
);
```

Have a look at the [tests][te] for more hints on how to use this library.
